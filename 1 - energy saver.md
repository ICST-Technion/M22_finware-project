Chat with Tom:

Busy Sensor:
==================
Feature was disabled in iPhone and Android from ~2018
He talks about it like its hard


Expiration date scanner
===================
Usually tries to have projects that can be opensourced or used outside of the lab.
He feels its a too "vision" project and doesnt feel iot for him.


Ultra wideband authentication
===================
Did not like this idea


E-ink display
===================
Doesn't really think is the thing


Tom's new ideas:
===================
1. Api that you give it access to bank and shows it on a fridge or something. Maybe add an e-ink display.



Can we start at something and change in the middle?
===================================
Not really, doesnt want to do this
